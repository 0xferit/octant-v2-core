/**
 * @title YieldForwarder
 * @author [Golem Foundation](https://golem.foundation)
 * @custom:security-contact security@golem.foundation
 * @notice Immutable, single-purpose contract that calls report() on a strategy,
 *         redeems any resulting profit shares, and forwards the underlying assets
 *         to a hardcoded receiver
 * @dev Designed for trust-minimized yield flows where this contract serves as both
 *      the strategy's keeper (authorized to call report()) and the donation address
 *      (receives profit shares). Only an authorized keeper EOA can trigger it.
 *
 *      CALL CHAIN:
 *      Keeper EOA → reportAndForward() → strategy.report() → profit shares minted
 *      to this contract → redeem shares → assets forwarded to receiver
 *
 *      DESIGN:
 *      - Fully immutable: no admin, no upgrades, no sweep
 *      - Keeper-gated: only the designated keeper can trigger
 *      - Single-purpose: assets can only flow to the hardcoded receiver
 *      - Strategy is passed as a call-time parameter to avoid circular dependencies
 *
 *      COMPATIBILITY NOTE -- `enableBurning` loss absorption:
 *      A YieldForwarder is not a reliable `dragonRouter` for loss absorption.
 *      `reportAndForward` tries to drain the forwarder's share balance after every
 *      report, but the redemption is only best-effort: it is capped at
 *      `strategy.maxRedeem(forwarder)` (residual shares remain when external vault
 *      headroom is tight) and it is skipped entirely when `convertToAssets(shares)`
 *      rounds to zero on a loss-impaired strategy (dust share balances remain).
 *      Under `enableBurning = true`, only whatever happens to be sitting at the
 *      forwarder at loss time can be burned, and that amount is not guaranteed.
 *      Operators who want to actually rely on burn-based loss protection must use
 *      a non-forwarder dragon (EOA, multisig, or a splitter that retains balance
 *      between reports).
 *
 *      OPERATIONAL NOTE -- airdrop / keeper-only strategy APIs:
 *      When this contract is wired in as a strategy's `keeper`, any strategy
 *      function gated by `onlyKeepers` (for example SparkStrategy.sweepAirdrop)
 *      cannot be invoked by this contract -- this forwarder only exposes
 *      `reportAndForward` (and, for the swapping variant, `reportSwapAndForward`).
 *      Management must retain an operational channel (multisig, automation key,
 *      etc.) to call those keeper-gated strategy functions directly. For airdrops
 *      routed through `sweepAirdrop`, management should coordinate an immediate
 *      keeper call to `YieldForwarder.forwardToken(airdropToken)` to move the
 *      swept balance onward to the hardcoded receiver.
 *
 *      MIGRATION NOTE -- 14-day dragon-router cooldown:
 *      Because this contract is intended to act as both `keeper` and
 *      `dragonRouter`, migrating a strategy to or away from a forwarder is
 *      coupled to the TokenizedStrategy dragon-router cooldown. On
 *      TokenizedStrategy, `setKeeper(address)` takes effect immediately, but
 *      `setDragonRouter(address)` only enqueues the change -- it emits
 *      `PendingDragonRouterChange` and starts a 14-day timer, and the new
 *      router only becomes active once anyone calls
 *      `finalizeDragonRouterChange()` after the cooldown has elapsed. In
 *      practice every forwarder swap is a >=14-day operation. The delay is an
 *      intentional security invariant of the yield-skim design and is not
 *      bypassable by design.
 *
 *      For compromised-keeper incident response, the correct posture is:
 *        1. Call `setKeeper(newKeeper)` on the strategy (onlyManagement).
 *           This takes effect immediately and neutralises the compromised
 *           forwarder: the forwarder's `reportAndForward` (and
 *           `reportSwapAndForward`) now revert inside `strategy.report()`
 *           because the strategy no longer recognises the old forwarder as a
 *           keeper. No 14-day wait is involved in this step.
 *        2. Concurrently call `setDragonRouter(newRouter)` on the strategy
 *           to queue the donation-address change and start the 14-day
 *           cooldown.
 *        3. After 14 days, call `finalizeDragonRouterChange()` on the
 *           strategy to activate the new dragon router.
 *        4. Optional: `shutdownStrategy()` can be used at any point during
 *           the response to block new deposits and mints. It does NOT stop
 *           `report()`, `tend()`, or donation-share minting on profit --
 *           those continue to work post-shutdown -- so shutdown is a
 *           deposit-inflow brake, not a way to neutralise a compromised
 *           keeper. Use step 1 for that.
